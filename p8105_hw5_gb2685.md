## Problem 1

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("Data/homicide-data.csv") %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition ==  "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, resolved) %>%
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Looking at this a bit

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize (
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Can I do a prop test for a single city?

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter( city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter( city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Try to iterate

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>%
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>%
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  theme(axis.text.x= element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1 ))
```

*Making a spaghetti plot:*

``` r
long_study %>%
ggplot( aes(week_number, observation, group = paste(subject_id, arm), color = arm)) + geom_line() +
labs (
  x = "week number",
  y = "values"
)
```

## Problem 3

Creating a function so that a sample of size 30 is taken and then the
ttest is run on it to get the estimate and p values. Also used tidy from
broom to get estimate and p value from the messy output.

``` r
library(broom)
set.seed(1)

sim_normal_ttest = function(n =30, mu, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
  sim_data %>% 
  t.test()%>%
  tidy() %>%
  select (c(estimate, p.value))
  
}
```

Running the above function 5000 times:

``` r
sim_results = 
  rerun(5000, sim_normal_ttest(30, 0, 5)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

Running the above function 5000 times for every different mu:

``` r
sim_results = 
  tibble(mu = c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6)) %>% 
  mutate(
    output_lists = map(.x = mu, ~rerun(5000, sim_normal_ttest(mu = .x))),
    estimate_dfs = map(output_lists, bind_rows)) %>% 
  select(-output_lists) %>% 
  unnest(estimate_dfs)
```
